# Capstone Project Proposal
## January 10, 2018

What is the problem you want to solve?
```
The problem I aim to solve through this project is determining which business types are the best indicators for predicting housing prices within San Francisco.
```

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?
```
My client is anyone who is in the San Francisco housing market or is speculating on entering the market. Based on the results of the analysis, a model for identifying opportunities for profit in the market can be produced. Furthermore, the data could be used to assist with exit timings. 
```

What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
```
The datasets to be used are the yelp dataset and the quandl zillow dataset for San Francisco.

The Yelp dataset has been acquired from the following address: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download. 

The Yelp dataset includes the following attributes for each business:
1. Business_ID - unique ID
2. Name 
3. Neighborhood - categorical string
4. Address
5. City 
6. State 
7. Postal Code
8. Latitude
9. Longitude
10. Stars - numeric
11. Review_Count - numeric
12. Is_Open - binary
13. Attributes (takeout, parking types)
14. Categories  - categorical 
15. Hours

In this dataset, we have a combination of categorical, binary, and numeric data types that could be used. 

The Zillow dataset contains the following attributes for each property:
1. RegionID
2. RegionName - Categorical String
3. ZHVI - numeric

Multiple datasets exist which may be of interest. Within the Zillow dataset. To be discussed with mentor.


```

In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
```
To be discussed

```


What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
```
Deliverables for this project are as follows:
1. Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data acquisition, data cleaning, data exploration analysis and machine learning model development.
2. A report on the capstone project
3. A presentation on the capstone project
