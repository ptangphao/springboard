# Capstone Project Proposal
## January 10, 2018

What is the problem you want to solve?
```
The problem I am aiming to solve is determining whether a housing valuation algorithm built on Zillow's dataset can be improved utilizing an overlay of Yelp Data.
```

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?
```
My client is anyone who is in the Southern California housing market or is speculating on entering the market. Based on the results of the analysis, a model for identifying opportunities for profit in the market can be produced. Furthermore, the data could be used to assist with exit timings. Lastly, the model could be of potential interest to both Yelp and Zillow.
```

What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
```
The primary dataset involved is the Zillow dataset obtained through the following link:

Additionally data will be obtained using the Yelp API and through data engineering with tools such as Python's Geopy, we will obtain the required information for the Yelp Dataset.

```

In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

```
To solve this problem, my steps will be as follows:

1. Obtain Zillow Dataset
2. Build a model utilizing the dataset.
3. Add engineered data based on real estate knowledge using the Yelp API.
4. Incremental model comparison
5. Final feature selection.

```


What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
```
Deliverables for this project are as follows:
1. Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data acquisition, data cleaning, data exploration analysis and machine learning model development.
2. A report on the capstone project
3. A presentation on the capstone project
